            <h1>I am like you.</h1>
            <p>The similarities between our nervous systems far outweigh the differences.</p>
            <p>I moved from California to Helsinki 3 years ago to be close to family and to pursue further education in methods of data analysis.</p>
            <p>However, formal education only goes so far, and I still long to understand at a deeper level, not only the components of my field of work, but broader topics that directly impact how I live.</p>
            <p>Right now I'm particularly interested in best programming practices, philosophy of life, learning the Finnish language, and ways of understanding and interacting with others.</p>
            <p>I'm a big fan of taking responsibility for one's actions and state of mind at the level of everyday behavior, despite also believing that most of who we are and where we are is outside of our control. I understand that I am privileged in having the mental and physical resources I do, and try to make the most of that.</p>
