            <h1>About Karmen</h1>
            <p>Originally from the Northern hills of post-hippie California, I've been in Helsinki 3 years now to be close to family and to study programming and methods of data analysis. Accustomed to the presence of large unhealthy and destitute populations in the USA, I'm fascinated by the Finnish social system and how it seems to prevent some of the worst kind of human horror stories.</p>
            <p>I'm in a learning mode right now - what are the best programming practices and how do I improve? How to balance building friendships with quiet alone time? How does one both focus and live a meaningful life? How to build community and share knowledge in a way that is both constructive for all involved, and not terribly stiff?</p>
